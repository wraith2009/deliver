what is virtual dom?
-->we need virtual dom for reconciliation in react.
react uses reconciliation to use def algo (this algo finds out what needs to be updated).

--->>> react uses something known as virtal dom it is not a actual dom it is rep of actual dom
and react also uses reconciliation . reconciliation has def algo which finds out the difference 
between trees . it will only rerender the portion of app which is found out by the def algo.

---->> we use key : suppose if we had 4 div now there are 5 div and if we dont have key react will rerender all
of the div but if we have key react will only rerender that specific things.

---> react fibre is a new reconciliation engine it was introduced in react 16 and it is responsible for diff-algo.

---> <></> these are react.fragments.

---> if we do export default it exports the title but why use default?

--->Micro-services: instead of having one project we have bundle of small projects.
Advantages: easier to test , easy to maintain, easy to change (seperation of concerns).

---> Important points about hooks:
# never write a useState inside a if() condition and loops
useState is a hook which react gives you to create local state var inside ur functional component.


----> there are two types of routing one is client-side and other is server-side.
in server-side routing out pages comes from server.


--> what is redux?
If the application is very small you dont need redux. Redux and React are different things.
